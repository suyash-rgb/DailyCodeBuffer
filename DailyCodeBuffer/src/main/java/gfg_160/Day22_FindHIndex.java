Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] represents the number of citations for the ith paper, you have to compute the H-index of the researcher.
The H-index is defined as the maximum value H such that the researcher has at least H papers with at least H citations each.

Examples:

Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are at least 3 papers (3, 5, 3) with at least 3 citations.

Input: citations[] = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 3 papers (with citation counts of 5, 2, and 4) that have 2 or more citations. However, the H-Index cannot be 3 because there aren't 3 papers with 3 or more citations.

Input: citations[] = [0, 0]
Output: 0
Explanation: The H-index is 0 because there are no papers with at least 1 citation.

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ citations.size() â‰¤ 106
0 â‰¤ citations[i] â‰¤ 106
