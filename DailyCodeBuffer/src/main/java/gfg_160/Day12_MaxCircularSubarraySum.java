You are given a circular array arr[] of integers, find the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray. In a circular array, the subarray can start at the end and wrap around to the beginning. Return the maximum non-empty subarray sum, considering both non-wrapping and wrapping cases.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [8, -8, 9, -9, 10, -11, 12]
Output: 22
Explanation: Starting from the last element of the array, i.e, 12, and moving in a circular fashion, we have max subarray as 12, 8, -8, 9, -9, 10, which gives maximum sum as 22.

Input: arr[] = [10, -3, -4, 7, 6, 5, -4, -1]
Output: 23
Explanation: Maximum sum of the circular subarray is 23. The subarray is [7, 6, 5, -4, -1, 10].

Input: arr[] = [-1, 40, -14, 7, 6, 5, -4, -1]
Output: 52
Explanation: Circular Subarray [7, 6, 5, -4, -1, -1, 40] has the maximum sum, which is 52.

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
-104 <= arr[i] <= 104
